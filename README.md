# moodle-library-widget
This is a JQuery script and HTML object written for Armacost Library at the University of Redlands. 

The JQuery script displays our LibChat chat box and the contact information of the appropriate subject librarian in a Moodle course. The HTML code creates a placeholder <div> into which the JQuery script writes its data; it can be inserted into the Moodle course template to automatically appear in all courses. 
  
The JQuery code uses a pseudoselector and a switch statement to identify which department the Moodle course is taught from, and assign the correct subject librarian. Code for the LibChat box was provided from LibChat.
